# CS 7641 Machine Learning Project
ML Based User-Centric Hotel Recommendations System

# Definition and Motivation
Checking the ratings/reviews had been the most commonly used method for identifying a suitable choice while booking a Hotel. However, the major concern here is that these ratings were given based on the unique perspective of a single user. One person's 5-star rating can be another person's 2-star rating	. Some people might prefer a low price over the ambiance, while others might choose the hotel with better ambiance irrespective of the price. 

Our aim is to aid the user by providing more personalized hotel recommendations by considering his preference of various aspects such as price, food, ambiance, etc rather than showing a general rating of the hotel. This in turn helps the user in identifying the most suitable hotel based on his choice, more efficiently and quickly.
