Personalized Hotel Recommender using Sentiment Analysis
# Introduction
<div align ="justify"> Traveling is one of the most fundamental human activities. While traveling, finding good accommodation is the most challenging part. Based on the statistics of 2018 travel booking, there were about 148 million online travel bookings, out of which 82% were via an app or website [1]. This draws attention to the reliance of people on websites and apps for finding accommodation. Most of these websites and apps have one or other metrics to help users to book hotels, however, oftentimes they lack being user-centric, taking into account different variables for each user. A lot of work on this topic of hotel recommendation systems, takes just the user preference and not hotel reviews or doesnâ€™t compute the difference of importance for different users [2]. </div>

# Problem Definition and Motivation
<div align ="justify"> When reserving a hotel, the most popular approach for making a good decision has been to read the ratings and reviews. But the main issue here is that these evaluations were made based on the viewpoint of one individual. A 5-star rating for one person may be a 2-star rating for another. Some people would select a hotel with a lower price over the ambiance, while others might do so regardless of cost. 
<br>
<br>
Instead of displaying a generic hotel rating, our goal is to help the customer by making more individualized hotel suggestions that consider their preferences for different factors like pricing, cuisine, atmosphere, etc. In turn, this facilitates a quicker and more effective process for the customer to choose the best hotel depending on their preferences.
